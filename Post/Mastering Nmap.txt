Introduction
Nmap (Network Mapper) is one of the most powerful and versatile open-source tools for network scanning, host discovery, and security auditing. Developed by Gordon Lyon (aka Fyodor), it has become a core utility in every penetration testerâ€™s toolkit.

This post summarizes the **comprehensive 85+ page Arabic guide** from Green Armor Cyber Security, now distilled into an essential reference for the H.T.Dark community.

Key Capabilities of Nmap:
Host Discovery: Identify live systems on a network.
Port Scanning: Detect open, closed, or filtered ports.
Service Detection: Determine running services and their versions.
OS Detection: Identify target operating systems via TCP/IP fingerprinting.
Scriptable Scanning: Use Lua-based NSE scripts for advanced probing.
Firewall/IDS Evasion: Employ decoys, spoofing, fragmentation, etc.

Essential Commands Summary:
Bash:
# Basic host scan
nmap 192.168.1.1

# Range scan
nmap 192.168.1.1-254

# Subnet scan
nmap 192.168.1.0/24

# Full port scan
nmap -p- 192.168.1.1

# Aggressive scan (OS + Services + Scripts + Traceroute)
nmap -A target.com

# Stealth SYN scan
nmap -sS target.com

# UDP scan
nmap -sU target.com

# Detect service versions
nmap -sV target.com

# Detect OS
nmap -O target.com

# Use NSE script
nmap --script http-enum target.com

# Top 100 ports
nmap -F target.com

# Output in all formats
nmap -oA scan_output target.com

Firewall Evasion & IDS Bypass Techniques:
Bash:
# Fragment packets
nmap -f target.com

# Use decoy IPs
nmap -D RND:5 target.com

# Spoof MAC address
nmap --spoof-mac Apple target.com

# Randomize scan order
nmap -r target.com

# Slow timing (to avoid detection)
nmap -T1 target.com

NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine): Advanced Usage
The NSE allows you to automate tasks like brute force attacks, service enumeration, and vulnerability detection.
Bash:
# Run all vulnerability scripts
nmap --script vuln target.com

# Run multiple scripts
nmap --script=ssh-auth-methods,http-enum target.com

# Provide script arguments
nmap --script http-brute --script-args userdb=users.txt,passdb=pass.txt target.com

Scan Timing Templates:
Code:
-T0: Paranoid (very slow, stealthy)
-T1: Sneaky
-T2: Polite
-T3: Normal (default)
-T4: Aggressive
-T5: Insane (fast, noisy)

Use Cases in Cybersecurity:
Asset inventory and mapping.
Vulnerability discovery via version detection and NSE scripts.
Pre-engagement reconnaissance in Red Team operations.
Firewall rule assessment and evasion.
Incident response and breach analysis (IR & DFIR).

Legal & Ethical Considerations:
Never scan systems you do not own or lack explicit permission to test. Unauthorized scans can be illegal and lead to criminal prosecution depending on the jurisdiction.

ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion
Nmap remains a cornerstone tool in cybersecurity operations. With a rich set of commands, evasion techniques, and automation via NSE, it empowers red teamers, sysadmins, and blue teams alike.
