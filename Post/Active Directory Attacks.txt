1Ô∏è‚É£ Kerberoasting Attack: Silent Takeover of Service Accounts
‚úÖ How It Works:
‚è∫ Attackers extract TGS (Ticket Granting Service) tickets from service accounts.
‚è∫ Crack them using tools like Hashcat.
‚è∫ If the password is weak, they escalate privileges easily.

üí• Defense:
‚è∫ Use gMSA to automatically rotate service account passwords.
‚è∫ Monitor SPNs (Service Principal Names) for unusual activity.
‚è∫ Enforce long and complex passwords for service accounts.


2Ô∏è‚É£ DCSync Attack: Stealing the Entire AD Database
‚úÖ How It Works:
‚è∫ Attackers exploit Replicator Directory Changes privileges to extract NTDS.dit.
‚è∫ Gain access to all user hashes and full network control.

üí• Defense:
‚è∫ Limit accounts with replication permissions.
‚è∫ Enable LSA Protection to block hash dumping.
‚è∫ Encrypt LDAP traffic to prevent sniffing.


3Ô∏è‚É£ CVE-2025-21293: Privilege Escalation via Network Operators
‚úÖ How It Works:
‚è∫ Users in the Network Configuration Operators group can modify registry keys for services like DnsCache and NetBT.
‚è∫ Allows malicious code execution with SYSTEM privileges.

üí• Defense:
‚è∫ Patch all systems immediately.
‚è∫ Audit and clean up the Network Operators group.
‚è∫ Use Sysmon to monitor registry changes.


4Ô∏è‚É£ Golden Ticket & Silver Ticket: Fake Kerberos Tickets, Real Control
‚úÖ How It Works:
‚è∫ Golden Ticket: A forged Kerberos ticket using the KRBTGT account for domain-wide access.
‚è∫ Silver Ticket: A forged ticket for a specific service (e.g., SQL Server), harder to detect.

üí• Defense:
‚è∫ Rotate the KRBTGT key every 180 days.
‚è∫ Monitor Kerberos traffic with Microsoft ATA.
‚è∫ Disable RC4-HMAC and use AES-256 instead.


5Ô∏è‚É£ MITM6 Attack: IPv6-Based Man-in-the-Middle
‚úÖ How It Works:
‚è∫ Exploits the default IPv6 enablement in Windows to launch MITM attacks and steal credentials.

üí• Defense:
‚è∫ Disable IPv6 if unused.
‚è∫ Enable RA Guard and DHCPv6 Guard on switches.
‚è∫ Enforce SMB Signing to prevent relay attacks.


‚úÖ Proactive Defense Strategies:
‚è∫ Apply the "Least Privilege" principle across all accounts.
‚è∫ Disable legacy protocols like NTLM and SMBv1.
‚è∫ Enforce MFA for privileged accounts.
‚è∫ Keep isolated and restorable backups of NTDS.dit.
‚è∫ Use tools like BloodHound to uncover hidden attack paths.
